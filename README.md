## CleverTap Campaign planner

### What 
This script does below 4 jobs at high level:
1. Gets the CleverTap campaigns scheduled between 1-2 hour from now. (for ex: if current time is 2pm, it fetches campaigns which are scheduled between 3pm-3:59pm)
2. Gets the userbase of each campaign by running headless automation
3. If a campaign's userbase exceeds the max-limit(for the time frame it was originally set to run), it computes the **earliest possible schedule time in the same 1 hour window**.
4. Sends a report on slack with the above computed preferred schedule time. The report also has a Notes column which mentions whether there was a change in time, or if could not find any time frame within 1 hour window.


### How to setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Add `.env` file with the required values*
3. In CLI, run `sh script.sh` to run the script right now.
4. To setup crontab, which runs the script periodically every hour:
   1. In CLI, run `crontab -e`
   2. Add `0 * * * * sh $HOME/clevertap-campaign-planner/script.sh` and save. (this will run the script at the start of every hour)
      1. You will need to allow full disk access to crontab inorder to run the hourly script. 
   3. Verify crontab using `crontab -l`
